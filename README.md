# 💼 Developer Portfolio

Hi! I'm **Casper Pelsma**, a computer science student at the technical university of applied sciences in Rosenheim. I’ve spent most of my time building web-based applications, but I’m equally excited by the challenges of general software development and engineering better systems..  
This repository contains a selection of my personal and academic projects that showcase my skills in software development and system design.
